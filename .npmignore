# Everything ABOVE here is boilerplate copied directly from .gitignore. It would be great if I could
# somehow automatically include that here, since I often use standardized boilerplate .gitignore files,
# and even though the vast majority of the rules above aren't relevant to npm packages, it's still
# included so that I can at least manually diff the .npmignore against my standard .gitignore files.

# NPM publish-specific rules follow:
src/
test/
tsconfig.json
.github/
# mocks/ TODO(tjohns) This project doesn't HAVE mocks, yet, BUT I actually DO 
# often want to include mocks, but typically only for DevDependencies. Until 
# we can figure out how to create both a "standard" npm module and one that 
# includes mocks and source and sourcemaps and... and... and... for 
# DevDependencies ONLY, I'll just leave this comment here as a painful 
# reminder that I haven't figured out a great way to do that yet. If you're 
# reading this and know a way, let me know, or better yet, blog about it and 
# send me a link and I'll promote it.
